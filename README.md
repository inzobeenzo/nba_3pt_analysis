# NBA Three-Point Shot Value Analysis

This project analyzes historical NBA shooting data to evaluate trends in three-point usage, efficiency, and scoring impact across eras.

## Motivation
The modern NBA has seen a dramatic increase in three-point attempts. This project investigates whether the three-point shot provides disproportionate value relative to other shot types.

## Methods
- Exploratory data analysis of league-wide shooting data
- Expected value calculations for shot types
- Visualization of historical trends and efficiency metrics

## Results
Findings suggest that increased three-point usage is supported by higher expected value under modern efficiency conditions, though trade-offs exist depending on accuracy assumptions.

## Deliverables
- Analysis notebook
- Visualizations
- Presentation slides (PDF)

## Tools
R / tidyverse, ggplot2, ggpubr
